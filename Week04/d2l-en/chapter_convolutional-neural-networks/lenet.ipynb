    ":label:`sec_lenet`\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have all the ingredients required to assemble\n",
    "a fully-functional CNN.\n",
    "In our earlier encounter with image data,\n",
    "we applied\n",
    "a softmax regression model (:numref:`sec_softmax_scratch`)\n",
    "and\n",
    "an MLP model (:numref:`sec_mlp_scratch`)\n",
    "to pictures of clothing in the Fashion-MNIST dataset.\n",
    "To make such data amenable to softmax regression and MLPs,\n",
    "we first flattened each image from a $28\\times28$ matrix\n",
    "into a fixed-length $784$-dimensional vector,\n",
    "and thereafter processed them with fully-connected layers.\n",
    "Now that we have a handle on convolutional layers,\n",
    "we can retain the spatial structure in our images.\n",
    "As an additional benefit of replacing fully-connected layers with convolutional layers,\n",
    "we will enjoy more parsimonious models that require far fewer parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce *LeNet*,\n",
    "among the first published CNNs\n",
    "to capture wide attention for its performance on computer vision tasks.\n",
    "The model was introduced by (and named for) Yann LeCun,\n",
    "then a researcher at AT&T Bell Labs,\n",
    "for the purpose of recognizing handwritten digits in images :cite:`LeCun.Bottou.Bengio.ea.1998`.\n",
    "This work represented the culmination\n",
    "of a decade of research developing the technology.\n",
    "In 1989, LeCun published the first study to successfully\n",
    "train CNNs via backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time LeNet achieved outstanding results\n",
    "matching the performance of support vector machines,\n",
    "then a dominant approach in supervised learning.\n",
    "LeNet was eventually adapted to recognize digits\n",
    "for processing deposits in ATM machines.\n",
    "To this day, some ATMs still run the code\n",
    "that Yann and his colleague Leon Bottou wrote in the 1990s!\n",

    "## LeNet\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, (**LeNet (LeNet-5) consists of two parts:\n",
    "(i) a convolutional encoder consisting of two convolutional layers; and\n",
    "(ii) a dense block consisting of three fully-connected layers**);\n",
    "The architecture is summarized in :numref:`img_lenet`.\n",

    ":label:`img_lenet`\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic units in each convolutional block\n",
    "are a convolutional layer, a sigmoid activation function,\n",
    "and a subsequent average pooling operation.\n",
    "Note that while ReLUs and max-pooling work better,\n",
    "these discoveries had not yet been made in the 1990s.\n",
    "Each convolutional layer uses a $5\\times 5$ kernel\n",
    "and a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "These layers map spatially arranged inputs\n",
    "to a number of two-dimensional feature maps, typically\n",
    "increasing the number of channels.\n",
    "The first convolutional layer has 6 output channels,\n",
    "while the second has 16.\n",
    "Each $2\\times2$ pooling operation (stride 2)\n",
    "reduces dimensionality by a factor of $4$ via spatial downsampling.\n",
    "The convolutional block emits an output with shape given by\n",
    "(batch size, number of channel, height, width).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to pass output from the convolutional block\n",
    "to the dense block,\n",
    "we must flatten each example in the minibatch.\n",
    "In other words, we take this four-dimensional input and transform it\n",
    "into the two-dimensional input expected by fully-connected layers:\n",
    "as a reminder, the two-dimensional representation that we desire uses the first dimension to index examples in the minibatch\n",
    "and the second to give the flat vector representation of each example.\n",
    "LeNet's dense block has three fully-connected layers,\n",
    "with 120, 84, and 10 outputs, respectively.\n",
    "Because we are still performing classification,\n",
    "the 10-dimensional output layer corresponds\n",
    "to the number of possible output classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While getting to the point where you truly understand\n",
    "what is going on inside LeNet may have taken a bit of work,\n",
    "hopefully the following code snippet will convince you\n",
    "that implementing such models with modern deep learning frameworks\n",
    "is remarkably simple.\n",
    "We need only to instantiate a `Sequential` block\n",
    "and chain together the appropriate layers.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* A CNN is a network that employs convolutional layers.\n",
    "* In a CNN, we interleave convolutions, nonlinearities, and (often) pooling operations.\n",
    "* In a CNN, convolutional layers are typically arranged so that they gradually decrease the spatial resolution of the representations, while increasing the number of channels.\n",
    "* In traditional CNNs, the representations encoded by the convolutional blocks are processed by one or more fully-connected layers prior to emitting output.\n",
    "* LeNet was arguably the first successful deployment of such a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replace the average pooling with maximum pooling. What happens?\n",
    "1. Try to construct a more complex network based on LeNet to improve its accuracy.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the convolution window size.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the number of output channels.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the activation function (e.g., ReLU).\n",
    "    1. Adjust the number of convolution layers.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the number of fully connected layers.\n",
    "    1. Adjust the learning rates and other training details (e.g., initialization and number of epochs.)\n",
    "1. Try out the improved network on the original MNIST dataset.\n",
    "1. Display the activations of the first and second layer of LeNet for different inputs (e.g., sweaters and coats).\n"
